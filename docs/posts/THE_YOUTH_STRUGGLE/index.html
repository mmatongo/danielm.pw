            <p>I’ve always admired the <a href="https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/youth-struggle">South African Youth Struggle</a> and if you grew up much like me, then at some point in your early childhood you may have seen the 1992 classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105316/">Sarafina</a> starring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000155/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Whoopi Goldberg</a>.</p>
<p>The movie is centred around the introduction of the Afrikaans language as a means of teaching which leads to outrage driving the plot from there, but this isn’t a movie review or an attempt to tug at your nostalgia. What my young mind at the time couldn’t perceive hidden behind the musical notes of what I still think is a masterpiece despite it’s 6.4 IMDb rating was the chorus cry for change.</p>

<p>I live (like many of my readers) in Zambia, a country that has known only peace in it’s 56 (soon to be 57) years of independence. And after 57 years of “<strong><em>independence</em></strong>,” it’s saddening to see a nation come full circle, to reach a point where a government silences the voices of its people, fights its youth for questioning it and threatens violence to those that seek order. That’s how long it took a nation, 57 years to begin fighting the very spark that ignited the flames of the Zambian fight for freedom, to begin silencing the voices that’ll carry influence into the next generation. Why? Because they fear us, they fear what we’re capable of because they were once us, <strong><em>YOUTH</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They fear you because you are young.<br />
They fear you because you are the future.”</p>
<p>― <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105316/">Sarafina</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re probably might be reading this thinking to yourself, “What is he talking about, Zambia is a free nation.” And you’re right by your standards by mine however, this certainly isn’t independence.</p>
<p>If it is then why are citizens being threatened, why are our rights being taken away from us, why can’t we express ourselves like we once could and why can’t we rally in the streets to protest against an unjust system, <strong><em>WHY?</em></strong></p>
<p>The threat is apparent, to stifle a revolution quench the flame before it spreads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The violence, the beatings, the torture, the killings; all this is the birth pain of our free nation.”</p>
<p>― <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105316/">Sarafina</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I can’t speak for a time before I became analytically observant (ignorance is bliss), the more I look at the current state of affairs the more I wonder exactly where we are going. What does it take for a people to breathe a sigh of relief and exclaim “Now, we are free!”?</p>
<p>Silence has always been the death of any revolution.</p>
