<title>uETCHED uIN uMEMORY</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The question, “What year do you look back to with fondness?” often causes my mind to race back to the year 2014, not that anything special happened in 2014. I like to think that the reason I always look to it with much fondness is that it was my last year in high school and looking back now, I never thought a detail I often considered insignificant would have such great impact on how I look back to that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But I have my life, I’m living it. It’s twisted, exhausting, uncertain, and full of guilt, but nonetheless, there’s something there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Banana Yoshimoto, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/13216114"&gt;The Lake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve made it a habit to ask friends and close acquaintances the seemingly arbitrary question, “What year do you often look back to with fondness?” the question itself lacking no real specificity asks the seemingly impossible. I mean how do you respond to a question that doesn’t ask for an exact moment in time but rather asks you to sieve out the good from the bad, measuring out each year to see it’s worth in either the joy it gave or the joy it took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Oscar Wilde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you look at this seemingly pointless question the more you begin to sieve out the good from the bad and with confidence, you can easily blurt out a year that by your own standards was good, that had in it joy and sadness and how even the sadness within it you look back at it with fondness, with spirited comfort knowing deep down that despite all the hurdles that life presented you during that sliver of eternity, you came out strong. &lt;strong&gt;You came out on top.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God surely did not create us, and cause us to live, with the sole end of wishing always to die. I believe, in my heart, we were intended to prize life and enjoy it, so long as we retain it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Charlotte Brontë, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2685457"&gt;Shirley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you look back to it and see the joy, pain, sadness and tears cried in laughter and you remember only those moments, the simple yet beautiful moments &lt;em&gt;etched in memory,&lt;/em&gt; like the inscriptions of a vandal on the walls of your mind announcing, “We have known joy, we have known sadness, we have seen the bitterness of life and we have embraced its kindness and through it all, we have lived.” And with each breath since, we have lived &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Roy T. Bennett, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/49604402"&gt;The Light in the Heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>uKIND uEYES</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For as long as I can remember, I have always loved taking walks. I’m not sure if it’s the calmness of natures silence or my desperate need to wholly embrace the company of self, whatever the case, I have always loved taking walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my many walks, I would always see trees and flowers of various kinds in varying conditions. I always appreciated their subtle beauty and marvelled at some of the trees and their monolithic and sometimes humble sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery—air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,”This is what it is to be happy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Sylvia Plath, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1385044"&gt;The Bell Jar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I was reading on the practice of observing without judgment and the more I read, the more I began to see the disparity of human observance, how we look upon nature so differently to the way we look upon ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its imperfection, all nature is imperfectly perfect. How easy it is to look at the crooked tree and see only the artistic beauty behind how it twists and turns, how it curves as it stretches out to follow the sunlight in a dance that can only be attributed to nature’s artistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Dass"&gt;Ram Dass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much like trees, not everyone got the same measure of sunlight, or to sprout in-kind soils, or to grow where the waters are bountiful, or to know the kindness of a gaze filled with awe at their beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you look at all men as you do tree’s, you won’t say “Why are you like this?” or “You’re too this,” you will merely accept them for who they are and in doing so, will embrace the true beauty of humanity, that in our vast diversity, we are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;imperfectly perfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That our beauty is expressed by our diversity, that with each distinct difference we are set apart from the next and defined as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and not merely a semblance of perfection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>uTHE uYOUTH uSTRUGGLE</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always admired the &lt;a href="https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/youth-struggle"&gt;South African Youth Struggle&lt;/a&gt; and if you grew up much like me, then at some point in your early childhood you may have seen the 1992 classic &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105316/"&gt;Sarafina&lt;/a&gt; starring &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000155/?ref_=tt_cl_t2"&gt;Whoopi Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is centred around the introduction of the Afrikaans language as a means of teaching which leads to outrage driving the plot from there, but this isn’t a movie review or an attempt to tug at your nostalgia. What my young mind at the time couldn’t perceive hidden behind the musical notes of what I still think is a masterpiece despite it’s 6.4 IMDb rating was the chorus cry for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Freedom is coming tomorrow”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― &lt;a href="https://g.co/kgs/Qm4jEE"&gt;Sarafina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live (like many of my readers) in Zambia, a country that has known only peace in it’s 56 (soon to be 57) years of independence. And after 57 years of “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;independence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,” it’s saddening to see a nation come full circle, to reach a point where a government silences the voices of its people, fights its youth for questioning it and threatens violence to those that seek order. That’s how long it took a nation, 57 years to begin fighting the very spark that ignited the flames of the Zambian fight for freedom, to begin silencing the voices that’ll carry influence into the next generation. Why? Because they fear us, they fear what we’re capable of because they were once us, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;YOUTH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They fear you because you are young.&lt;br /&gt;
They fear you because you are the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105316/"&gt;Sarafina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re probably might be reading this thinking to yourself, “What is he talking about, Zambia is a free nation.” And you’re right by your standards by mine however, this certainly isn’t independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is then why are citizens being threatened, why are our rights being taken away from us, why can’t we express ourselves like we once could and why can’t we rally in the streets to protest against an unjust system, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHY?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat is apparent, to stifle a revolution quench the flame before it spreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The violence, the beatings, the torture, the killings; all this is the birth pain of our free nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105316/"&gt;Sarafina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can’t speak for a time before I became analytically observant (ignorance is bliss), the more I look at the current state of affairs the more I wonder exactly where we are going. What does it take for a people to breathe a sigh of relief and exclaim “Now, we are free!”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence has always been the death of any revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Coco Chanel&lt;/p&gt;

<title>uWHO uAM uI</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, my names are Matongo Mulindi but to most people that know me I go by the name of Daniel.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve never written a blog before, but after what has seemingly been a quasi-quarter life crisis or just an inquisitive youth trying to navigate the chaos that is the millennial age (I’m yet to figure out which of the two it is), I’ve decided to give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose what has drawn me to this, is the beauty of simultaneously creating something that can be your own whilst availing it to millions of people. To add to that is the subtle beauty of the internet in it’s everlasting and somewhat indestructible nature, to have your mind and thoughts etched into the annals of time, a record that can either be made for positive or negative impact.&lt;br /&gt;
What we record and put out there helps shape the world for us and future generations, this power should be embraced and not hidden away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge is power. Power to do evil…or power to do good. Power itself is not evil. So knowledge itself is not evil.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Veronica Roth, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/15524549"&gt;Allegiant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been an observant side-liner, I’ve come to realize that I needed a place of expression, a place to tell a story or share my pseudo satirical views of the current status quo.&lt;br /&gt;
So here it is welcome to my blog, my little slice of the internet to express my love for the simple things, to air my voice on all things political, business, and human. A place to share my thoughts with you and hopefully to inspire more people to, no matter who they are, do the same at some level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to take all that I’ve discovered, learned and experienced and share it with the world, with you and in sharing, to grow, discover, learn and experience more things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be candid, I’m not sure what this blog will become but I’m a firm believer of consistency and it’s rewarding and though life is a fickle mistress (it seems the harder we push against it, the harder it pushes back), so I’m not going to make any grand promises, but what I will promise is to provide my honest, down-to-earth views and opinions and to just be me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I have to give you some pre-warning, I’ve never been much of a poet by any means though I have dabbled and made a few publications to various websites in a much different time so I’ll stick to what I feel comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I started to write this post, I did a quick google search on what my first post should be about. It gave me a list of what should and shouldn’t be included and I think I’ve covered most of them.&lt;br /&gt;
However, one of the points that resonated with me most, was to encourage you guys to get involved. That could be through asking me questions and suggesting topics for me to cover but also and most importantly, to challenge me. We learn faster and build off our differing opinions, so don’t hold back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go, a very small snippet of who I am and what to expect! Hopefully, you want to see and learn more about who I am and what I’m doing… If so, read on and enjoy the journey with me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
