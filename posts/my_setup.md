Decided to do one of these because everyone does one of
these.

My entire setup is managed with GNU `stow`, making it easier
to replicate on fresh installations. You can find my
configuration files on [GitHub](https://github.com/nerdypepper).

I run Void Linux (glibc) on my
[HP Envy 13" (2018)](https://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/laptops/envy-13).
To keep things simple, I run a raw X session with `2bwm` as my
window manager, along with `dunst` (notification daemon) and
Sam's [`compton`](https://github.com/sdhand/compton)
(compositor) fork.

I am a fan of GNU tools, so I use `bash` as my shell, and
`coreutils` to manage files, archives, strings, paths etc. I
edit files with `vim`, chat with `weechat`, listen to music
with `cmus`, monitor processes with `htop`, manage sessions
with `tmux`, read pdfs in `zathura`. I rarely ever leave
the comfort of my terminal emulator, `urxvt`.

Most of my academic typesetting is done with TeX, and
compiled with `xelatex`. Other *fun* documents are made with
GIMP :).
